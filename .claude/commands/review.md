You are an AI assistant tasked with reviewing code changes and running tests for a Python FastAPI project. Your goal is to ensure the quality and correctness of the code by analyzing the changes, identifying potential issues, and executing the appropriate tests.

<github_workflow>
.github/workflows/pr.yaml
</github_workflow>

This contains the GitHub workflow configuration for the project's CI/CD pipeline.

<fastapi_config>
[Optional: requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or setup.py]
</fastapi_config>

This contains the configuration and dependencies for the FastAPI project.

First, review the GitHub pull request.

<github_pr>
#$ARGUMENTS
</github_pr>

Follow these steps to review the code and run the tests:

1. Analyze the GitHub workflow:
Identify the test steps and commands used in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., pytest, uvicorn, httpx, etc.).

Note any environment variables, test coverage, or linting tools used (e.g., pytest-cov, ruff, mypy, etc.).

2. Examine the FastAPI configuration:
Review requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or setup.py for test-related dependencies.

Identify any scripts, tools, or options used to run tests or lint checks.

3. Review the code changes:
Analyze the code changes in the PR to understand the purpose and impact.

Check for potential issues including:

Logic errors or incorrect API behavior

Missing validation or error handling

Security vulnerabilities (e.g., unescaped inputs, excessive permissions)

Poor API design or inconsistent documentation (e.g., missing response_model, status_code)

Look for new endpoints, models, or services that may need additional test coverage.

4. Execute the tests:
Based on the workflow and project config, determine the appropriate test commands (e.g., pytest, coverage run, uvicorn --reload).

Execute the following tests, if applicable:

a. Unit tests

b. Integration tests (e.g., API route tests using TestClient)

c. End-to-end tests (e.g., tests interacting with full app stack or external systems)

d. Custom test suites or tools (e.g., schema validation, contract testing)

Capture all test outputs and note any failures or skipped tests.

5. Prepare a report on the review and test results:
Format your response as shown below:

<review_report>
1. Code Changes Summary:
[Provide a brief overview of the changes and their purpose]

2. Potential Issues:
[List any concerns or problems identified during the code review]

3. Test Results:
a. Unit Tests: [Pass/Fail, include any error messages]
b. Integration Tests: [Pass/Fail, include any error messages]
c. End-to-End Tests: [Pass/Fail, include any error messages]
d. Custom Tests: [Pass/Fail, include any error messages]

4. Suggestions:
[Offer recommendations for improvements or additional testing]

5. Overall Assessment:
[Provide a final evaluation of the code changes and test results]

Ensure that your report is concise yet comprehensive, focusing on the most critical aspects of the code review and test results.
